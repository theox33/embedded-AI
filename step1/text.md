# Key Components of Computer Vision

## Common computer vision pipeline :

1. **Scene**: The initial input, typically an image or video frame.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Capturing the scene using cameras or sensors.
3. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing images quality through techniques like normalization, resizing, noise reduction, etc.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Identifying and extracting important features from the images, such as edges, corners, textures, or specific patterns.
5. **Post-processing**: Classifying objects, detecting features, segmenting scenes.
6. **Recognition & Understanding**: Interpreting the processed data to recognize objects, actions, or scenes.
7. **Decision Making**: Using the recognized information to make decisions or trigger actions in applications like autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, etc.
